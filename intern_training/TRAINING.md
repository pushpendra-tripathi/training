You may use existing `modules/*` content in this repo as optional references, but the new plans are self‑contained.

### Ground rules and setup (Day 0)
- Environment
  - Install Python 3.12+, and create a virtual environment (`python -m venv .venv`).
  - Create a working repo: `intern-<name>-playground` on GitHub.
  - Install and configure local quality tools: `black`, `isort`, `pylint`.
- Git/GitHub
  - Configure SSH keys and your user settings.
  - Use feature branches and open small, focused PRs to `main`.
  - Write clear, imperative commit messages.

### Daily problem solving
- Every day includes 45–60 minutes of problem solving from LeetCode or Project Euler. Suggested links are embedded in each week plan.

### Weekend assignments
- Each week ends with a weekend assignment that consolidates the week’s learning. Details and deliverables are specified in the corresponding `intern_training/week0X.md` file.

### Practical milestones and promotion gates
- Week 1 → Week 2: CSV analytics CLI; code passes `black`, `isort`, `pylint`.
- Week 2 → Week 3: Django Task Tracker with CRUD, admin, templates; search/filter/pagination working.
- Week 3 → Week 4: Authenticated app with DRF API; filtering and tests passing.
- Week 4 → Week 5 (bonus): Template-driven UI polished; admin with custom action; tests passing.
- Week 5 (optional): Fullstack demo with frontend consuming Django API.
