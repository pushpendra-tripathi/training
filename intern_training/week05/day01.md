## Week 5 · Day 1 — Frontend Scaffold + API Consumption

### Objectives
- Build a simple static frontend scaffold and render tasks from the Django API.

### Tasks
1) Scaffold
   - Copy `frontend_template/` or use it as reference for your frontend.
   - Serve locally (e.g., `python -m http.server`).
2) Fetch tasks
   - Implement `api.js` to call `/api/tasks/` and handle errors.
   - Render list with loading and error states and a basic status filter.

### Problem solving (45–60 min)
- LeetCode: [Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/) (revisit with stack variations)
- Project Euler: [Problem 7](https://projecteuler.net/problem=7)

### Outcomes
- Frontend renders tasks from the backend with basic UX states.

### Deliverables
- Static page listing tasks via API; short README notes on how to run it.

### Submission checklist
- [ ] API call to `/api/tasks/` works and handles errors
- [ ] Loading/empty/error states visible
- [ ] README includes run instructions
