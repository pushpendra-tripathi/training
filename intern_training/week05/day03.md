## Week 5 · Day 3 — Create/Update Flows and Form UX

### Objectives
- Implement create and update flows on the frontend with client/server validation.

### Tasks
1) Create Task form
   - Build a form; call `POST /api/tasks/`; surface validation errors.
2) Edit Task flow
   - Add an edit UI; call `PUT/PATCH /api/tasks/<id>/`.
3) UX
   - Loading states, disabled buttons during submit, toast messages.

### Problem solving (45–60 min)
- LeetCode: [Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/), Euler: [Problem 8](https://projecteuler.net/problem=8)

### Outcomes
- Reliable forms that handle success and validation errors cleanly.

### Deliverables
- Screens/GIF of create and edit flows; README notes.

### Submission checklist
- [ ] Create and edit flows work; validation errors visible
- [ ] Loading/disabled states implemented
- [ ] README updated
