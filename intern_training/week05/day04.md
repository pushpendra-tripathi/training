## Week 5 · Day 4 — UI Polish and State Management

### Objectives
- Organize JS into small modules and improve UI responsiveness.

### Tasks
1) Modules
   - Split JS into `api.js`, `state.js`, `ui.js` with clear responsibilities.
2) UX polish
   - Add loading skeletons/spinners, empty and error states, and toasts.
3) Sorting/filtering
   - Add client-side sorting and better filter UX.

### Problem solving (45–60 min)
- LeetCode: [3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/), [LRU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/)

### Outcomes
- Cleaner code structure and improved perceived performance.

### Deliverables
- Updated frontend with modules and UX improvements.

### Submission checklist
- [ ] JS modules separated; responsibilities clear
- [ ] UX polish visible (skeletons, toasts, empty states)
- [ ] Sorting/filtering implemented
