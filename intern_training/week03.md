### Weekend assignment
**Algorithm Portfolio Project**

Build a comprehensive algorithm library with:
1. **Implementations**: Stack, Queue, Binary Search, Merge Sort, Tree Traversals
2. **Tests**: Full pytest suite with edge cases for each algorithm
3. **Documentation**: 
   - README with complexity analysis table
   - Docstrings with examples and Big-O notation
   - Pattern guide (when to use which algorithm/data structure)
4. **Problem Solutions**: At least 30 problems from ProblemBank_DSA.md with:
   - Multiple approaches (brute force → optimized)
   - Complexity analysis
   - Pattern identification
5. **Quality**: `black`, `isort`, `pylint` pass; type hints throughout

**Acceptance criteria:**
- All implementations tested and working
- 30+ DSA problems solved with tests
- Complexity documented for each solution
- Pattern guide clear and useful
- Code quality tools pass

### Suggested problems (30-40 total for the week)
- See `intern_training/ProblemBank_DSA.md` (Core/Stretch/Challenge)
- Daily quota: 5-8 problems
- Focus on understanding patterns, not just solving
