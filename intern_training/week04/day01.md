## Week 4 · Day 1 — Templates Deep Dive

### Objectives
- Strengthen Django template skills: inheritance, blocks, includes, filters, and tags.

### Tasks
1) Base layout
   - Create `base.html` with blocks for `title`, `content`, and a global messages area.
2) Includes and partials
   - Extract nav, footer, and task item partials; reuse across pages.
3) Filters and tags
   - Use built-in filters (date, truncatechars, safe); add one custom template filter (e.g., badge for status).

### Problem solving (45–60 min)
- LeetCode: Revisit an array/string problem of choice; focus on clean solutions.

### Outcomes
- Clean, DRY templates with reusable components and custom filters.

### Deliverables
- Screenshots of pages using base and partials; short notes on custom filter.
