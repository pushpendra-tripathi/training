### Weekend assignment
**Production-Ready Django Application**

Build a fully-featured, deployment-ready Task Tracker:

1. **Authentication**:
   - User registration, login, logout
   - Password reset (email simulation)
   - Per-user task isolation
2. **Features**:
   - Full CRUD with ownership checks
   - Pagination (10 per page)
   - Search by title/description
   - Filters: status, date range, tags
   - Bulk actions (mark multiple as done)
3. **Forms**:
   - Robust validation with clear error messages
   - Inline validation feedback
   - Success/error messages throughout
4. **Admin**:
   - Fully configured with all useful features
   - Custom actions
   - Inline editing
5. **API (Optional)**:
   - RESTful endpoints for tasks
   - Token authentication
   - Proper HTTP status codes
6. **Performance**:
   - Optimized queries (select_related/prefetch_related)
   - Database indexes on frequently queried fields
   - Query count benchmarks documented
7. **Testing**:
   - >90% coverage
   - Unit tests for models, views, forms
   - Integration tests for user flows
   - API tests (if applicable)
8. **Documentation**:
