## Week 3 · Day 4 — Testing Basics

### Objectives
- Write unit tests for models, forms, views, and API endpoints.

### Tasks
1) Test setup
   - Choose `pytest` or Django’s `unittest` and configure test discovery.
2) Model and view tests
   - Test `Task` creation rules; test list view authentication and filtering.
3) API tests
   - Test success and failure cases for create and list endpoints.

### Problem solving (45–60 min)
- LeetCode: [Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/), [Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)

### Outcomes
- Confidence that critical flows work and remain working after refactors.

### Deliverables
- `tests/` with a few well-named tests; README instructions to run tests.

### Submission checklist
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] Covers models, views, and APIs minimally
- [ ] Code passes `black .`, `isort .`, `pylint **/*.py`
