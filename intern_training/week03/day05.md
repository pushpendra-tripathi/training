## Week 3 · Day 5 — Pagination and Simple Performance

### Objectives
- Add pagination and get familiar with basic query optimization patterns.

### Tasks
1) Pagination
   - Ensure list views and API endpoints use pagination with sane defaults.
2) Query review
   - Use Django shell to inspect queries; consider `select_related`/`prefetch_related` where relevant.
3) Notes
   - Document observed query counts and the effect of pagination.

### Problem solving (45–60 min)
- LeetCode: [Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/), Project Euler: [Problem 6](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6)

### Outcomes
- More responsive list endpoints and basic performance awareness.

### Deliverables
- README section summarizing pagination settings and any query changes.

### Submission checklist
- [ ] Pagination works on web and API
- [ ] Query notes documented
- [ ] Code passes `black .`, `isort .`, `pylint **/*.py`
