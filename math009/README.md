# Problem No. 9

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, `a < b < c`, for which, `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`

## Part A

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000. Find the product `abc`.

Edit the file answer.py and update the function `answer()` to return the answer.

## Part B

Write code for solver.solver() to find all pythagorean triplets whose sum lies between `p` and `q`, inclusive, and return a dictionary where the key is the sum and the value is a list of all tuples whose sides add up to the key.

Solve for the range all numbers less than or equal to `p` if only `p` is provided

Solve for the range between `p` and `q` if `p` and `q` are both provided

```python
In [1]: solver(12)
Out[1]: {12: [(3, 4, 5)]}
```
