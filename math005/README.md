# Problem 5

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the
numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

## Part A

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by 
all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

Edit the file answer.py and update the function `answer()` to return 
the answer.

```
answer()
```

## Part B

Write a function in python that returns the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers between the range `p` and `q`, inclusive.

Use the range from the lesser of `p` and `q` to the greater of `p` and `q`. Make no assumption about which is lesser or greater.

Edit the file solver.py to update the function `solver` to return the answer when called as in the below example.

```
solver(p, q)
```
