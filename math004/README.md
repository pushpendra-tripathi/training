# Problem 4

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest 
palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009.

```
9009 = 91 x 99
```

## Part A

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Edit the file answer.py and update the function `answer()` to return the answer.

```
answer()
```

## Part B

Write a function that returns the largest palindrome from the product of two n-digit numbers where both numbers are inside a range.

```
solver(n, p=None, q=None)
```

The range is defined as between:
- the first n digit number to to p if only p is provided
- p and q if p and q are both provided
