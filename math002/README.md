# Problem 2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

```
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
```

## Part A

Find the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million.

Edit the file answer.py and update the function `answer()` to return the answer.

```
answer()
```

## Part B

Write a function in python that returns the sum of all even and/or odd 
terms of the Fibonacci sequence that are inside the range defined by 
`start` and `end` inclusive. 

Consider even numbers when `even` is True and disregard when `even` is False.

Consider odd numbers when `odd` is True and disregard when `odd` is False.

Edit the file solver.py to update the function `solver` to return the 
answer when called as in the below example.

The function should return `None` if `start` is greater than `end`.

```
solver(start, end, even=False, odd=False)
```
